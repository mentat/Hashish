Hashish Basic Installation
==================

	1) ./configure
	2) make
	3) make install

The configure script will check to see if you have wxWindows 2.3.1
or better installed on your system.  If you do not have this installed
please download it from http://www.wxwindows.org

The files will also try to link to CryptoPP 4.2 located in $(libdir),
which is usually /usr/local/lib and the file name is libcryptopp.a.  
The CryptoPP headers should be in $(includedir)/cryptopp, this is
usually /usr/local/include/cryptopp

Download CryptoPP from http://www.cryptopp.com
